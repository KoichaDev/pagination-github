The purpose is fetching the API call from github of displaying 100 repos, and then creating 20 rows, and 5 pagination buttons. 

If it's 30 rows, then it will be 3 pagination buttons. Basically just take 100 repos and divide it with how many rows you want it to
display on the front-end and the pagination will be automatically be generated for you.
